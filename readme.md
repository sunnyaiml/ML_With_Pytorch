# Linear Regression with PyTorch 🔢🔥

This project provides a clean and well-documented implementation of **Linear Regression** using PyTorch. It’s designed to help beginners understand one of the most fundamental machine learning algorithms from the ground up, with clear explanations and practical code examples.

The notebook walks through:
- Core theory of linear regression
- Step-by-step model construction in PyTorch
- Training and evaluation loops
- Insights and areas for future enhancement

## 📚 About the Project

### What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is a basic yet powerful supervised learning algorithm used to predict a continuous outcome variable (target) based on one or more input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the input(s) and the output.

> Example use case: Predicting a person’s **weight** based on their **height**.

### Key Components

- **Dependent Variable (Y):** The output we aim to predict (e.g. weight, price, temperature).
- **Independent Variable (X):** The input(s) used for prediction (e.g. height, time, features).
- **Weights and Bias:** Parameters that the model learns to best fit the data.
- **Loss Function:** Measures the difference between predicted and actual values. This project uses **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
- **Optimizer:** Algorithm that updates model parameters to minimize the loss function—here, we use **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**.

## 🧪 Features Implemented

- Built from scratch using **PyTorch tensors** and **autograd**
- Manual data creation to simulate a simple linear relationship
- Forward and backward propagation
- Loss calculation and optimization loop
- Clear separation of each process with markdown explanations

## 🚀 Future Improvements

To enhance this foundational project, the following features will be added:

- ✅ Add support for multiple input features (multi-variate regression)
- ✅ Implement model saving/loading using `torch.save()`
- ✅ Integrate real-world dataset (e.g., CSV import with Pandas)
- 🔲 Add dynamic learning rate scheduler
- 🔲 Visualize training loss using Matplotlib
- 🔲 Provide error analysis with plots
- 🔲 Implement a validation split and metric tracking

These improvements are Necessary for a robust and production-ready model which will be covered in the next project.
